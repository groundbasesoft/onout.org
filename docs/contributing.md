Add your product to onout.org and get rewarded from each sale of this product. (this means you work for one month, and earn üèñ passive income).

## How much you will earn ? 
Usecase: First product which made with "revshare" model called "FarmFactory" earns 1900 USD every month (the stats is open https://codecanyon.net/item/farmfactory-ethereum-assets-staking-yield-farming/29987071 ) . You think not so much? In comparison with full time job yes. But

- ‚úÖ this revenue coming fully automatically (all bugs are fixed, developer don't spend a lot of time).
- ‚úÖ this is not fulltime job (where you get paid for time spent), this is not "freelance job" (get paid once for job has done). Our is "spent time now, get money for years".   
- ‚úÖ in this case: the developer spent about 100 hours for this product. let's calculate 50 USD per hour = 3000 USD he would receive at "regular" job. But from farm factory he has received ~20 000 USD (calculated on 50% revshare model, real revenue share persent is less, but you will get 50%)
- ‚úÖ you can work with us without leaving your full time job 
- ‚úÖ it's like a game development, you release a game on steam.com and earn each sale

## Risks?
People don't like risk according  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion theory. So this let's see to the statistics of other our products (Calculated on November 2022): 

| Name             | Release date   | Investments (Developer's rate), USD | Earnings, USD | APY                              | ROI |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|-----|
| MCW              | March 2019     | 200 000 USD                         | 100 000       | 14% |  50%    |
| FarmFactory (revsahre model)      | January 2022   | 4000 USD           | 40000         |     1100% ü§©                       | 1000%    |
| LotteryFactory   | May 2022       | 6000 USD                            | 8000          |  250%                                | 133%    |
| Unifactory       | February 2022* | 10000 USD                           | 16200         |  211%                                | 162%    |
| Dao widget       | December 2021  | 2000 USD                            | 11800         |  624%                                | 590%    |
| CrossChain       | April 2022     | 6000 USD                            | 4000          |  107%                                | 66%    |
| NFTcy            | March 2022     | 5000 USD                            | 3000          |  85%                                | 60%    |

where: **Investments** = Developer's rate * time he spent . 
**ROI (Return of investment)** = Money we recieved from clients in USD, ETH, BNB.  <br>
**APY** = ROI / days since release * 365 <br>


As you can see most of them are profitable and earnings IS NOT stopped, better if we calculate APY. As you can see some of products rock, but the best one is developed based on revenue share model. Let's see on the weak projects.  

1. MltiCurrencyWallet. Originally it was an Atomic Swap exchange we spent 80% budget to deliver unnecessary function (nobody need atomic swap now). This product was venture funded. Now it's completed good product. Lesson: do not do complex product without real product market fit. 
2. CrossChain. We deliver complex product for corporate market (only big project need bridges and mostly of them already has in-house development team). 
3. NFTcy. At different times, 3 different developers started working on this project. We use Rarible.org api so in't not needed to hire a blockchain developer. We spent a lot of energy on managing. Also, rabble API is not complete bug-free api and does not support BSC. Lesson: we need "self-managed", experienced developers.  

## Resume
- ‚úÖ we (team) made a lot of mistakes and now have a profitable business model. 
- ‚úÖ We must create products in partnerships with motivated developers    
- ‚úÖ Developer will earn more than on regular job for the same time
- ‚ùå We against complex and "a lot of features" ideas

# How to start

Why develop new products from ground up when there are **open source** projects available for copying?<br/>
Select a popular **open source** project, **fork** it, add an admin interface for customization, and record a video showcasing the project for pre-release.

## What to work with

**Open source** projects based on the blockchain technology.

## <a name="contributing0"></a> Stage 0 - Idea (developer)

One of the key criteria when searching for a project is the amount of users or commission it generates, as this number correlates with its popularity.<br/>

The examples for idea sources:

- [Gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)
- [Dappradar](https://dappradar.com/)
- [Defipulse](https://www.defipulse.com/defi-list)
- [Cryptototem](https://cryptototem.com/ico-list/)
- [Golden](https://golden.com/query/list-of-cryptocurrency-companies-E5Y)
- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=fork&source=main_banner&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=fork)
- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/services/search?q=fork)

Once you come up with an idea:

0. Study the documentation for the original project ([What to look for in documentation?](./faq.md#what-do-i-look-for-in-documentation))
0. Locate the **primary** repository ([How do I locate the primary repository?](./faq.md#how-do-i-locate-the-primary-repository)).
0. Locate any **secondary** repositories ([How do I locate the secondary repositories?](./faq.md#how-do-i-locate-secondary-repositories))
0. Come up with a product name ([How do I come up with a product name?](./faq.md#how-do-i-come-up-with-a-product-name))
